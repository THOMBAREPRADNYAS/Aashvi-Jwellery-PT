      <h1>MEET THE DESIGNER AASHVI</h1>
      <p>
        I am AASHVI. AASHVI is the unapologetic expression of me.
        <br /><br />
        My passion is to create precious jewellery that makes my customers feel
        whole.
        <br /><br />
        Each piece is a piece of art. Unique. Purposeful. Expressing all of me.
        <br /><br />
        AASHVI is my story. The story of empowerment. Of living the life I want,
        with no limits.
        <br /><br />
        I am proud of who I am. But only by expressing my true self, I can
        inspire, shining my light on others.
        <br /><br />
        I go my own way, creating a legacy. Unapologetically. Fearless. Against
        all odds. I am unmistakably me.
      </p>
      <h1>ABOUT AASHVI</h1>
      <p>
        <b> UNMISTAKABLY YOU</b>
        <br /><br />
        You are like no other. You are unmistakably you. And Aashvi was created
        to be the unapologetic expression of you.
        <br /><br />
        Its very name is the perfect evocation of what we are all about –
        celebrating the whole of you. Aashvi is the name of our founder and
        creative director, as well as a name meaning Goddess of Art and
        Knowledge. Because Aashvi's purpose is to create designs to bring out
        the radiance you have within you. Empowering you to shine your light on
        yourself and those around you, unapologetically. Just like a diamond.
        <br /><br />
        Being one of a kind, you deserve jewellery that sets you apart. To
        create a unique identity, Aashvi incorporates our signature diamond star
        into all her designs. A diamond star shines always and forever,
        celebrating your own light through both the finest materials and the
        most powerful symbolism. Because you are worthy of the attention our
        jewellery brings you. Because a star is what you are.
        <br /><br />
        All of Aashvi’s jewellery is unique. It is made with the highest
        artistic expression in mind, so it can be a worthy reflection of your
        life’s journey.
        <br /><br />
        Never apologise. Express who you are.
        <br /><br />
        You are unmistakably you.
