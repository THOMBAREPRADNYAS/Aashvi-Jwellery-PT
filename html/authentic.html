        Aashvi gives you the ultimate proof of your diamonds’ authenticity. Each
        piece of jewellery is accompanied by a Certificate of Authenticity
        detailing the diamonds’ origin and specifications.
        <br /><br />
        At Aashvi, we only work with suppliers who themselves are subject to
        strict certification protocols. They are all required to operate within
        the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme.
        <br /><br />

        What is KPCS? It is a strictly regulated process that compels suppliers
        to produce written guarantees for all supplied diamonds. This also
        ensures that the diamonds aren’t sourced illegitimately or from any of
        the conflict areas. Insisting on working solely with KPCS suppliers,
        Noreen is dedicated to providing you with authentic diamonds that are
        entirely conflict-free.

        “My highest values in life are being honest, true to myself and
        respectable to others. I believe in myself and I honour those around me.
        And the jewellery I create is a way for me to express that respect.”

        <br /><br />

        Aashvi - Founder and Creative Director, Aashvi Jwellery

        <b> WE ARE TRANSPARENT </b>
        <br /><br />
        With Aashvi, you can be sure you are dealing with an expert jewellery
        designer and craftsmen who are passionate about their work and fully
        transparent when it comes to making jewellery.

        <br /><br />

        Whenever you purchase jewellery designed by Aashvi, you get in
        possession of a piece of superb Thai craftsmanship. All of Aashvi's
        collections are designed and made entirely in the Thailand. The Thailand
        workshop employs craftsmen who specialise in different stages of the
        manufacturing process. We meticulously handcraft all our jewellery and
        by doing that, ensure each piece is finished to the highest possible
        standard.

        <br /><br />

        Our manufacturing process honours the same strict rules followed by
        royal jewellery makers throughout the ages. It starts with processing
        raw materials. A single piece of precious metal is first hand rolled
        with mills and pulled through draw plates. It is then filed, ground, and
        tooled. The finished handmade model undergoes jewellery polishing to
        prepare it for stone setting. Once the model is polished, expert stone
        setters hand cut seats into prongs and metal walls to support the gems.
        Finally, the stones are seated and meticulously secured, once again by
        the hands of a master stone setter.
        <br /><br />

        All our jewellery is hallmarked at Thai's Assay Office, while all our
        rings feature the town mark of Thailand, the Leopard’s head. You are
        always welcome to view them in person in the workshop.
        <br /><br />

        As a brand, we are driven by constant innovation and first-rate
        craftsmanship. That makes Noreen the very embodiment of outstanding Thai
        design.

        <br /><br />
        “My passion is to create precious jewellery that makes my customers feel
        whole. Each piece is a piece of art. Unique. Purposeful. Expressing all
        of me.”
        <br /><br />
