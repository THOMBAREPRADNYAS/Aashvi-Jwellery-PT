        With Aashvi, you can be sure the jewellery you purchase is made
        exclusively from Fairtrade Gold. This means it is ethically sourced and
        responsibly crafted.
        <br /><br />
        What is Fairtrade Gold certification? It is the world’s first
        independent ethical certification system for gold. It is devised to
        consider all the conditions in which gold is sourced and crafted,
        including working conditions, health and safety, women’s rights, child
        labour and environmental impact.
        <br /><br />

        As a result, gold certified to Fairtrade standards provides communities
        with better living and working conditions. By using exclusively
        Fairtrade gold, Aashvi ensures all the jewellery you purchase from us is
        responsibly manufactured, both environmentally and socially.

        <br /><br />

        “Taking care of the environment is our responsibility. What is more,
        when you treat nature and people with respect and care, you bring light
        into the beautiful world we live in. It brings you happiness.”

        <br /><br />

        Aashvi allows you to trace your diamonds’ entire journey and make sure
        it is not sourced from a conflict area. We make this possible by only
        ever using traceable diamonds.
        <br /><br />

        To trace your diamonds’ entire journey, from the mine itself all the way
        to the workshop, you only need to use the included Unique Diamond
        Identification Number. The mines from which we obtain our diamonds are
        located in Canada, Botswana, Namibia and South Africa. There they are
        all tracked and analysed to meet specific quality standards.

        <br /><br />

        As a responsible jewellery brand, Aashvi only works with suppliers that
        themselves follow strict certification protocols and government
        regulations. By doing this, we ensure all the diamonds you purchase from
        us are ethically sourced. It is also ensured that no part of the mining
        process has a negative impact on the area’s environment, wildlife, or
        population. To the contrary, policies for fair labour and infrastructure
        development in the areas from which we obtain our diamonds even work in
        favour of the communities that populate them.
        <br /><br />

        Apart from the Unique Diamond Identification Number, all of Aashvi's
        diamonds come with a laser inscription on the diamond itself,
        Independent Grading Report, and counterfeit-proof Certificate of
        Authenticity.
        <br /><br />

        We are a responsible jewellery brand committed to promoting and
        protecting ethical, social, and environmental practices. And we want you
        to rest assured that by purchasing our jewellery, you are being
        environmentally and socially responsible too.

        <br /><br />
        “Sustainability is both our legacy and our future. It is our brand’s
        ethos to protect the beauty of the world, nurture its people and duly
        conduct our business with utmost care.”
        <br /><br />
