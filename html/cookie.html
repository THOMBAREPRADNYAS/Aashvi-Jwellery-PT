      <h1>CATEGORY 1: STRICTLY NECESSARY COOKIES</h1>
      <p>
        At times we may use technology to track information and the patterns of
        behaviour of visitors to our website. This may include using a cookie
        internet file, a file that is sent by our website server to your
        computer, which we can access when you make return visits to our
        website. Only to enhance the performance of website. <br /><br />
        Storing cookies is a usual practice for our website that needs to
        remember what its users’ preferences are and we use cookies to keep
        track of your selections on the website.
        <br /><br />
        You can make changes to your browser to prevent this happening (visit
        www.aboutcookies.org for more information on this)
        <br /><br />
        If you choose not to receive cookies, you may still use most of the
        features on our website, including the ability to purchase items and
        interact with us.
        <br /><br />
        In line with the ICC Thailand Cookie Guide, four types of cookies
        function online: Strictly important and necessary cookies. These cookies
        are important and essential in order to enable you to navigate around
        the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the
        website. Without the essential cookies services you have asked for, like
        shopping baskets or e-billing, cannot be provided.
      </p>
      <h1>CATEGORY 2: PERFORMANCE COOKIES</h1>
      <p>
        These cookies collect important information about how visitors use a
        website, for example which pages visitors go to most often, and if they
        get error messages from web pages. These cookies do not collect
        information that show a visitor. All information these cookies collect
        is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how a
        website works.
      </p>
      <h1>​​​​​CATEGORY 3: FUNCTIONALITY COOKIES</h1>
      <p>
        These cookies inform the website to remember choices you make (for
        example your user name, language or the region you are in) and improve
        and enhance personalised features. For instance, a website may be able
        to provide you with local information of reports or traffic news by
        storing in a cookie the area in which you are currently located. The
        cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size,
        fonts and other parts of web pages that you can change to suit your
        requirements. They can also be used to provide services you have asked
        for example as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information
        which the cookies collect could be anonymised and will not track your
        browsing activity on other websites.
      </p>
      <h1>CATEGORY 4: TARGETING COOKIES OR ADVERTISING COOKIES</h1>
      <p>
        These cookies have been in place to deliver adverts and information
        which are to your interests. They can also be used to limit the number
        of times you may see an advertisement and help with the measure of
        effectiveness the advertising campaigns can have. They are mostly placed
        by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission. They
        capture information to remember that you have visited a website and then
        this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers.
        Most often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site
        functionality provided by the other organization and any other relevant
        information.
