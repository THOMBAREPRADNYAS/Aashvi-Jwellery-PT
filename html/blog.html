      <h1>WHERE DO DIAMONDS COME FROM?</h1>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="/images/dj2.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <p>
        Arguably the most popular gemstone of all times, the diamond, is at
        least as tough as it is delicate looking. It is a well-known fact that,
        being the hardest natural substance on Earth, a diamond can only be
        scratched or cut by another diamond. <br /><br />
        However, very few people know the origins of this substance and when it
        was first discovered.
        <br /><br />
        It was millions of years ago that the very first diamonds were formed.
        Even the manner of their formation sets them apart from all other
        gemstones, given that they are the only ones made up of a single element
        – carbon.
        <br /><br />
        Before the first diamonds could form, pure carbon needed to be exposed
        to extreme heat and pressure. This all occurred at least a hundred miles
        below the Earth’s surface. And if it weren’t for volcanic activity,
        diamonds never would have travelled any closer.
        <br /><br />
        It was over 2,400 years ago in India that people first discovered and
        mined diamonds. Today they can be found across the world, but remain
        just as rare, precious and valued as they were centuries ago.
      </p>
      <h1>WHAT ARE ROUGH DIAMONDS?</h1>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="/images/dj3.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <p>
        What would you see if you were to hold a rough diamond? Often referred
        to as uncut, raw or natural, rough diamonds are the ones that haven’t
        been cut, polished or treated in any way. <br /><br />
        Rough diamonds look exactly as they do when they have just been mined –
        mostly colourless crystal formations with rough surface but great
        lustre.
        <br /><br />
        Why do we say diamonds are mostly colourless? It is because most of them
        have traces of brown or yellow. Occasionally you will also see red,
        blue, green, orange and pink. Completely colourless rough diamonds are
        exceedingly rare, with price to match.
        <br /><br />
        Once they have been mined, rough diamonds undergo a certification
        process that ensures they haven’t been obtained illegitimately or from
        any of the conflict areas. Diamond suppliers who observe these
        regulations are issued a so-called Kimberley Process Certificate.
        <br /><br />
        Before they are ready for processing, rough diamonds are first sorted
        based on their quality level. The stones that meet the standards are
        then sent to professionals for cutting and polishing that result in
        enhanced brilliance and the finished product as we all know it.
      </p>
      <h1>HOW DIAMONDS ARE PROCESSED</h1>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="/images/dj4.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <p>
        To achieve the perfect results and the maximum brilliance, rough
        diamonds are processed in six different stages. <br /><br />
        <b> 1. MARKING </b> <br />
        The diamond first undergoes an assessment with special emphasis on
        locating irregularities known as inclusions. Inspecting them allows the
        specialists to determine the best cut for maximum value extraction. Only
        then can the diamond be marked for further processing.
        <br /><br />
        <b> 2. CLEAVING </b> <br />
        Cleaving is generally reserved only for larger diamonds. Dividing rough
        diamonds into smaller stones without shattering them requires careful
        planning and precise execution. It is done by cutting a groove into the
        stone and making it split along the prepared line by using a mallet.
        <br /><br />
        <b>3. SAWING </b><br />
        Once the rough stone is prepared, it is cut using specialist saws.
        Diamonds are incredibly tough which is why, even at 4,000 revolutions
        per minute, the process can take up to eight hours. That is also why
        companies are increasingly investing in laser equipment.
        <br /><br />
        <b>4. ROUNDING </b><br />
        Rounding is what gives diamonds their characteristic cone shape. To
        shape one, the specialists mount two diamonds on two separate rotating
        tools that keep them touching. The resulting friction is what rounds the
        diamond to look like a cone.
        <br /><br />
        <b> 5. FACETING</b> <br />
        The rounded diamond is given to two different specialists, lapper and
        brillianteer, for faceting. Faceting refers to polishing the diamond to
        create its facets, one by one and with the highest level of precision.
        <br /><br />
        <b> 6. FINISHING TOUCHES</b> <br />
        The faceted diamond is considered a finished product only after it is
        carefully inspected. Once that is done, approved diamonds are boiled in
        sulfuric and hydrochloric acids to remove any processing residue and
        bring out their brilliance.
      </p>
      <h1>CHOOSING A DIAMOND: THE 4C'S</h1>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="/images/dj5.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <p>
        We know how overwhelming it can be to have to choose a high-quality
        diamond. That is why we will use our expertise to give you information
        on the four most vital diamond attributes, also known as the 4 C’s:
        colour, clarity, cut and carat weight.
      </p>
      <h1>1. COLOUR</h1>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="/images/dj6.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <p>
        The most widely used diamond colour scale is the Gemological Institute
        of America scale. It categorizes diamonds into 14 individual grades,
        referring to them by letters D to Z. <br /><br />
        The most desirable and expensive diamonds are white or colourless stones
        belonging to grades D, E and F. Unless you are a professional, the
        difference between them isn’t visible to the eye.
        <br /><br />
        Diamonds with hints of yellow are still highly desirable, although not
        nearly as much as the colourless. The grades they are categorized into
        are K, L and M.
        <br /><br />
        Of course, some diamonds show too much yellow and aren’t considered
        desirable enough by most people. They are the diamonds from S, T, U, V,
        W, X, Y and Z grades.
      </p>
      <h1>2. CLARITY</h1>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="/images/dj7.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <p>
        The most widely used diamond clarity scale is once again the GIA scale.
        To grade a diamond, it is placed under 10x magnification and inspected
        for irregularities and imperfections known as inclusions. <br /><br />
        The rarest of all diamonds are of course Flawless or FL diamonds. Only
        one in 5,000 diamonds belongs in this grade.
        <br /><br />
        Generally just as desirable are Internally Flawless or IF diamonds. They
        are almost without inclusions, which can only be seen under
        magnification.
        <br /><br />
        Highly valued are also Very Very Slightly Included or VVS1 and VVS2
        diamonds. They generally don’t have larger inclusions, only a slightly
        higher number of irregularities.
        <br /><br />
        Only slightly more imperfect are Very Slightly Included VS1 and VS2
        diamonds. Still, their inclusions can only be seen under magnification.
        <br /><br />
        Diamonds that aren’t very sought after belong to Slightly Included or
        SI1 and SI2 grades. This is because their inclusions are visible to the
        naked eye.
        <br /><br />
        Diamonds that don’t meet the usual quality standards belong to Included
        or I1, I2 and I3 grades. Their inclusions aren’t just visible, but
        affect the diamond’s durability as well.
      </p>
      <h1>3. CUT</h1>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="/images/dj8.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <p>
        Contrary to popular belief, the cut of the diamond does not refer to its
        shape. It is a term used in regard to the overall quality of the way the
        diamond has been cut from its rough form. It ranges from very shallow to
        very deep. <br /><br />
        The quality of the cut is vital because it affects all other attributes
        of the diamond, including its size and brilliance.
        <br /><br />
        How does the cut affect the diamond’s size? A poor cut does not utilize
        as much of the stone as it could if it had been processed better.
        <br /><br />
        How does the cut affect the diamond’s brilliance? For example, if the
        stone has been cut too shallow or too deep, the light escapes through
        its bottom and doesn’t reflect enough light.
      </p>
      <h1>4. CARAT WEIGHT</h1>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="/images/dj9.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <p>
        Carat weight refers simply to the diamond’s weight. One carat equals 200
        milligrams, the most common carat weights being .50, .75, 1, 2 and 5
        carats. <br /><br />
        To choose the highest quality diamond, it is important to know that a
        higher carat weight does not necessarily mean a larger diamond.
        <br /><br />
        Size as such can’t be accurately reflected by carat weight because it is
        significantly affected by both cut and shape. For example, the Marquise
        cut is known for making lighter diamonds appear larger.
        <br /><br />
        That is why, when purchasing diamonds, it is vital to take both carat
        weight and size into account.
      </p>
      <h1>CHOOSING A DIAMOND SHAPE: THE 10 CUTS</h1>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="/images/dj10.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <p>
        We know choosing among the many gorgeous diamond shapes can seem
        impossible. That is why we will tell you what to watch out for and what
        exactly makes each of the shapes desirable. <br /><br />

        Before we go into individual shapes, it is good to know the following
        terms: facet, table and crown. While facet refers to any of the flat
        surfaces making up the shape of a diamond, table is the flat surface
        located at its very top. Finally, the entire visible surface of the
        diamond is called the crown.
      </p>
      <h1>DIAMOND SHAPES</h1>
      <p>
        <b> ROUND BRILLIANT </b> <br /><br />

        Being the most sparkling and versatile, the Round Brilliant cut is the
        buyer’s first choice more than half the time. While its shape will never
        go out of style, its cut offers the most brilliance.
        <br /><br />

        <b> PRINCESS </b>
        <br /><br />

        Designed in the 1970s, the Princess cut combines the best of two worlds
        – the evergreen elegance of classic shapes and the striking sharpness of
        modern cuts.
        <br /><br />

        <b> EMERALD </b>
        <br /><br />

        Worn by Grace Kelly herself, the Emerald cut is one of the oldest and
        most desirable. Its large table and striking ‘hall of mirrors’ effect
        make it at once unique and mesmerizing.
        <br /><br />

        <b> ASSCHER </b>
        <br /><br />

        Boasting both the ‘hall of mirrors’ effect and incredible lustre, the
        Asscher cut is among the most stunning shapes. Higher crown and smaller
        table can be thanked for its striking brilliance.
        <br /><br />

        <b> PEAR </b>
        <br /><br />

        Sometimes referred to as Teardrop, the Pear cut is one of the most
        sophisticated shapes. The gentle curve ending in a single point makes it
        simple and stunning at the same time.
        <br /><br />

        <b> RADIANT </b>
        <br /><br />

        Being the first square diamond with a brilliant cut, the Radiant cut
        makes for the most dramatic choice. The combination of shape and
        numerous facets results in a vibrant diamond.
        <br /><br />

        <b> OVAL </b>
        <br /><br />

        Boasting the sparkle of a Round Brilliant, the Oval cut could be called
        its rarer, more modern version. Its elegant, elongated shape creates the
        illusion that the diamond is bigger than it actually is.
        <br /><br />

        <b> CUSHION </b>
        <br /><br />

        Also referred to as Pillow, the Cushion cut has been around for two
        centuries. Still, it is one of the rarest choices, making it both
        special and valuable.
        <br /><br />

        <b> HEART </b>
        <br /><br />

        As the unmistakable symbol of love, the Heart cut is the perfect choice
        for the romantic. Since the shape can be hard to make out in smaller
        diamonds, it is recommended to go higher than .50 carats.
        <br /><br />

        <b> MARQUISE </b>
        <br /><br />

        Being both sophisticated and striking, the Marquise cut is made to
        impress. Its shape makes the fingers appear more slender, while the
        optimized carat weight makes the stone appear bigger.
      </p>
      <h1>ENSURING A DIAMOND’S AUTHENTICITY: THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS</h1>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="/images/dj11.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <p>
        Never buy a diamond that doesn’t come with a certificate of authenticity
        issued by an independent institute. It is safe to make an exception only
        when purchasing jewellery featuring diamonds smaller than .30 carats.
        <br /><br />

        What are the acceptable forms of diamond certification? What is most
        important is that the certification process is conducted by an institute
        that is both licensed and independent.
        <br /><br />

        Such institutes employ unbiased gemologists who take exact measurements
        and assess all the diamond’s attributes before issuing a certificate.
        <br /><br />

        The most well-known certificate of authenticity is the one issued by the
        Gemological Institute of America (GIA).
        <br /><br />

        Keep in mind that authentic diamonds are nowadays also marked with laser
        inscriptions. They are usually found on the diamond’s girdle and can be
        easily seen by using a magnification loop.
